## About
This project began with 5 people and an idea. Like many origin stories, this idea slowly formed into a tangible thing. Our idea was to create a local directory website for home service businesses. This website allowed homeowners to search and connect easily with trusted businesses with neighbor reviews and ratings. The services available would be vetted through our website administrators to ensure a safe and easy experience. Our hope with this website is to take the work out of house work.
